## Conventions

Predicates that end with `__` are considered private and should not be exposed as public APIs.

## TODO

-   [ ] Adjust variable names
-   [ ] Adjust whitespace
-   [ ] Solve project using _very advanced techniques_
-   [ ] Use modules to hide private implementations
-   [ ] Write explanatory comments for complicated predicates
-   [ ] Write unit tests
